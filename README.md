wlm-maps (Sweden)
========

A map for the Wiki Loves Monuments photograph contest.

This is a fork of [wlm-maps](https://github.com/emijrp/wlm-stats) by emijrp
adapted for use in the Swedish competition. 

All of the Sweden stuff is in the [sweden branch](https://github.com/lokal-profil/wlm-maps/tree/sweden).
Primarily the adaptation means only fetching Swedish monuments, different
coloured markers, type specific markers, country changed to type in popup,
id linked in popup for BBR and FMIS objects.

It is available in http://tools.wmflabs.org/lp-tools/wlm-maps/ or you 
can go through http://tools.wmflabs.org/plstools/maptestAC.html to trigger
a geolookup which will center the map on your position.
